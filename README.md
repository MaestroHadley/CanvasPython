# CanvasPython
This repository is built by me to include snippets of code written in Python for those using Canvas LMS API to manipulate their Canvas instance. 

Remember that ALL Canvas programs need to begin with an Access Token that you generate inside of Canvas by going to Account, Settings and then scrolling 
down to New Access Token. Keep this Access Token information private and protected.
